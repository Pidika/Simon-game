    Simon is a classic memory-based  game where players must follow a sequence of colors and sounds.
    The goal is to repeat the sequence correctly for as long as possible without making a mistake.
    Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play the Simon game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Start the Game
- Turn on the Simon game using the power button or switch.
- The game will start with a simple sequence.</li>

<li>Step 2: Pay Attention to the Sequence
- Watch and listen carefully as the game presents a sequence of colored buttons lighting up and emitting sounds.
- Remember the order of the colors as they are presented.</li>

<li>Step 5: Repeat the Sequence
- After the sequence is displayed, it's your turn to repeat it.
- Use your memory to press the colored buttons in the exact same order as they appeared during the sequence.</li>

<li>Step 6: Progressing through Levels
- If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add one more color to the sequence and play it back to you.
- Continue repeating the sequences correctly to progress through the levels.</li>

<li>Step 7: Making a Mistake
- If you press the wrong button or make a mistake while repeating the sequence, the game will display an error message sound.
- You will start over from the beginning.</li>

<li>Step 8: Keep Playing
- Continue playing, trying to remember and repeat longer and more complex sequences.
- The game will get more challenging as you progress through the levels.</li>

Remember, Simon is a game of practice, patience, and memory. The more you play, the better you'll become at remembering longer sequences. 
Take breaks if you feel overwhelmed, and challenge yourself to beat your personal best each time you play!
